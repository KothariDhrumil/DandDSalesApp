## üß™ Post-Deployment Validation

### First Build Test (To be done after merge)

#### Trigger the Build
- [ ] Merge PR to main/master branch
- [ ] Navigate to repository Actions tab
- [ ] Verify workflow run started automatically
- [ ] Check workflow name is "Build and Deploy"

#### Monitor Build Progress
- [ ] Java setup completes successfully
- [ ] Flutter setup completes successfully
- [ ] Dependencies install without errors
- [ ] Code generation completes
- [ ] Code analysis passes
- [ ] Tests pass (or skip if no tests)
- [ ] APK build completes
- [ ] App Bundle build completes
- [ ] Artifacts upload successfully

#### Verify Artifacts
- [ ] Scroll to "Artifacts" section in workflow run
- [ ] Verify `android-apk-release` artifact exists
- [ ] Verify `android-appbundle-release` artifact exists
- [ ] Verify `release-notes` artifact exists
- [ ] Download `android-apk-release`
- [ ] Extract and verify APK file exists
- [ ] Check APK file size (should be > 10 MB)

#### Test APK Installation
- [ ] Transfer APK to Android device
- [ ] Enable "Install from Unknown Sources"
- [ ] Install APK successfully
- [ ] Launch app
- [ ] Verify app loads without crashing
- [ ] Test basic functionality

### Build Badge Validation
- [ ] Navigate to repository main page
- [ ] Verify build badge appears in README
- [ ] Badge shows "passing" status
- [ ] Click badge to verify it links to Actions

### Manual Workflow Test
- [ ] Go to Actions tab
- [ ] Click "Build and Deploy" workflow
- [ ] Click "Run workflow" button
- [ ] Verify dropdown shows:
  - [ ] Branch selector
  - [ ] "Deploy to Google Play Store" checkbox
  - [ ] "Deploy to Apple App Store" checkbox
- [ ] Run workflow without checking deployment boxes
- [ ] Verify only build-android job runs

### Documentation Validation
- [ ] Click all links in README.md
- [ ] Verify QUICK_START.md is accessible
- [ ] Verify DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md is accessible
- [ ] Verify workflow README.md is accessible
- [ ] Verify CI_CD_FLOW.md is accessible
- [ ] Check all internal links work

## üîç Troubleshooting Checks

### If Build Fails

#### Check Dependencies
- [ ] Review "Get Flutter dependencies" step logs
- [ ] Verify pubspec.yaml is valid
- [ ] Check for dependency conflicts

#### Check Code Generation
- [ ] Review "Run code generation" step logs
- [ ] Verify all models have proper annotations
- [ ] Check for conflicting generated files

#### Check Analysis
- [ ] Review "Analyze code" step logs
- [ ] Fix any lint errors
- [ ] Update analysis_options.yaml if needed

#### Check Tests
- [ ] Review "Run tests" step logs
- [ ] Fix failing tests
- [ ] Ensure test files are valid

#### Check Build
- [ ] Review APK build logs
- [ ] Check for signing issues
- [ ] Verify build.gradle configuration

### If Artifacts Missing
- [ ] Check artifact upload step logs
- [ ] Verify build output paths are correct
- [ ] Check workflow permissions

### If Badge Not Showing
- [ ] Verify workflow file name matches badge URL
- [ ] Check repository visibility settings
- [ ] Clear browser cache

## üìä Performance Validation

### Build Time
- [ ] First build completes in < 15 minutes
- [ ] Subsequent builds with cache < 10 minutes
- [ ] Dependencies cached properly
- [ ] Gradle cache working

### Artifact Size
- [ ] APK size reasonable (typically 20-50 MB)
- [ ] App Bundle size smaller than APK
- [ ] No unnecessary files included

## üîê Security Validation

### Workflow Security
- [ ] No secrets in workflow file
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Secrets use GitHub Secrets
- [ ] Permissions properly scoped

### Code Security
- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Environment variables used correctly
- [ ] API keys not committed

## üöÄ Store Deployment Readiness

### Play Store (Future)
- [ ] Service account setup documented
- [ ] Signing configuration documented
- [ ] Required secrets listed
- [ ] Deployment steps prepared

### App Store (Future)
- [ ] Apple Developer account requirements documented
