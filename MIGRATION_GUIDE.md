# Migration Guide - Upgrading to Latest Build Configuration

This guide helps you understand what changed and how to work with the updated project.

## What Changed?

The project was missing platform-specific directories and using outdated build configurations. The following updates have been made:

### Before (Issues)
- ❌ No `android/` directory
- ❌ No `ios/` directory  
- ❌ No `web/` directory
- ❌ Outdated Gradle version
- ❌ Could not build the application
- ❌ Gradle errors about outdated plugins

### After (Fixed)
- ✅ Complete `android/` directory with modern Gradle 8.5
- ✅ Complete `ios/` directory with CocoaPods setup
- ✅ Complete `web/` directory for PWA support
- ✅ Android Gradle Plugin 8.3.0
- ✅ Kotlin 1.9.22
- ✅ Android SDK 34 (Android 14)
- ✅ Java 17 compatibility
- ✅ Fully buildable project

## Version Upgrades

| Component | Old Version | New Version |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Gradle | Outdated/Missing | 8.5 |
| Android Gradle Plugin | Outdated/Missing | 8.3.0 |
| Kotlin | Old | 1.9.22 |
| Compile SDK | Old | 34 (Android 14) |
| Target SDK | Old | 34 |
| Min SDK | - | 21 (Android 5.0) |
| Java Target | Old | 17 |
| iOS Minimum | - | 12.0 |

## For Existing Developers

If you were working on this project before, here's what you need to do:

### 1. Pull the Latest Changes

```bash
git pull origin main
```

### 2. Clean Your Workspace

```bash
# Clean Flutter build cache
flutter clean

# Clean iOS build (if on macOS)
cd ios
rm -rf Pods Podfile.lock
pod install
cd ..

# Clean Android build
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
```

### 3. Get Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 4. Verify Your Setup

```bash
flutter doctor -v
```

Make sure you have:
- Flutter SDK 3.0.0 or higher
- Android SDK with SDK 34 installed
- Java 17 or higher
- Xcode (macOS only) with iOS 12.0+ SDK

### 5. Build the App

```bash
# For Android
flutter build apk

# For iOS (macOS only)
flutter build ios

# For Web
flutter build web
```

## Breaking Changes

### Android

1. **Java Version**: Now requires Java 17 (previously Java 11 or lower)
   - Update your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable if needed
   - Android Studio should handle this automatically

2. **Gradle Version**: Now uses Gradle 8.5
   - Delete old `.gradle` directories if you encounter issues
   - The wrapper will download the correct version automatically

3. **Min SDK**: Set to 21 (Android 5.0+)
   - Devices older than Android 5.0 are no longer supported
   - This affects less than 1% of Android devices

### iOS

1. **Minimum iOS Version**: Set to 12.0
   - Devices older than iOS 12 are no longer supported
   - This includes iPhone 5s and earlier

### Dependencies

1. **Fonts**: The Roboto fonts in `pubspec.yaml` are temporarily commented out
   - Either add the font files to `assets/fonts/` directory
   - Or use system default fonts by leaving them commented

## New Project Structure

The project now has the complete Flutter structure:

```
DandDSalesApp/
├── android/          # ✅ NEW - Android platform code
├── ios/              # ✅ NEW - iOS platform code
├── web/              # ✅ NEW - Web platform code
├── lib/              # ✓ Existing - Dart source code
├── assets/           # ✅ NEW - Images, icons, fonts
├── test/             # ✓ Existing - Tests
└── pubspec.yaml      # ✓ Updated
```

## Common Issues After Migration

### Issue: "Gradle version mismatch"

**Solution:**
```bash
cd android
./gradlew --stop
rm -rf .gradle
cd ..
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

### Issue: "Java version incompatible"

**Solution:**
- Install Java 17 or higher
- Update `JAVA_HOME` environment variable
- In Android Studio: File → Project Structure → SDK Location → JDK Location

### Issue: "SDK 34 not found"

**Solution:**
- Open Android Studio
- Tools → SDK Manager
- Install Android 14.0 (API Level 34)

### Issue: "CocoaPods installation failed" (iOS)

**Solution:**
```bash
cd ios
rm -rf Pods Podfile.lock
pod repo update
pod install
cd ..
```

### Issue: "Module not found" errors

**Solution:**
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

## Testing Your Setup

After migration, run these tests to ensure everything works:

### 1. Run the App in Debug Mode

```bash
flutter run
```

### 2. Build Release APK

```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

### 3. Run Tests

```bash
flutter test
```

### 4. Analyze Code

```bash
flutter analyze
```

## CI/CD Changes

If you have CI/CD pipelines, update them to use:

- Java 17 or higher
- Android SDK 34
- Flutter 3.0.0 or higher

Example GitHub Actions snippet:
```yaml
- uses: actions/setup-java@v3
  with:
    distribution: 'temurin'
    java-version: '17'
    
- uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
  with:
    flutter-version: '3.24.0'
    channel: 'stable'
```

## Benefits of This Update

1. **Latest Features**: Access to latest Android and iOS platform features
2. **Better Performance**: Modern build tools are faster and more efficient
3. **Security**: Latest versions include security patches
4. **Compatibility**: Better support for modern devices and OS versions
5. **Future-Proof**: Ready for upcoming Flutter and platform updates
6. **Better Tooling**: Improved IDE support and developer experience

## Need Help?

If you encounter issues:

1. Check [BUILD_SETUP.md](BUILD_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions
2. Check [SETUP_GUIDE.md](SETUP_GUIDE.md) for troubleshooting
3. Run `flutter doctor -v` and share the output
4. Check the [Flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/)
5. Open an issue in the repository

## Rollback (Not Recommended)

If you absolutely need to rollback:

```bash
git log --oneline  # Find the commit before the platform directories were added
git checkout <commit-hash>
```

However, this will leave you with a non-buildable project. It's strongly recommended to move forward with the updated configuration.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Pull latest changes
2. ✅ Clean workspace
3. ✅ Update dependencies
4. ✅ Test build
5. Add your application icons
6. Add custom fonts (if needed)
7. Configure signing for release builds
8. Continue development with latest tools!
